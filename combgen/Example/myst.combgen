/* This is an example for a Myst (Cyan, 1993) playthrough. I decided to use it as an example for
 * a more complex combgen source file which is meant to show the limits and new useful features.
 * The use scenario is steganography using a Let's Play video/stream or (potentially) written
 * walkthrough (some data fields, however, are not really applicable to a written walkthrough)
 *
 * This file will not work with current-version combgen as it uses 32 bit arithmetic (and the
 * primary combinational expression is missing) */
